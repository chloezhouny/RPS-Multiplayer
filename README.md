# RPS-Multiplayer

This project builds a Rock Paper and Scissors as online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase. Only two users can play at the same time. Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
